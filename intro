Task: Color Identification in Images
      i.e.
      From an particular image I have to identify different colors / detect different colors
      So, here I have done two approaches

      -> You can detect any color present in the image
         for that you have to select the image and then you have to click on the color
         from the image that you want to identify, it will show the NAME of the COLOR on the top of the selected
         image as well as the RGB values for that particular color

      -> Here I just show all the pixels of the image which have the same color
         say you want to identify the RED color from the selected Image
         so it will show only RED pixels in the image
         for that I use a TRACKBAR by which you can control the HSV minimum and maximum values
         as you want
         -> This is very useful when you want to create a MASK for any particular color

Let's move to the DEMO of that ----->
